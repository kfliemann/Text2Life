DONE
-random button which inserts random text to let the player play around with random shapes
-convert text to seed & let create by seed (for BIG SHAPES)
-convert text to seed & let create by seed (for SMALL SHAPES)
-index.html styled up a little bit
-show generation
-slider to make the jump between generations faster or slower
-new game button
-show seed for big shapes

TODO
-pause when losing focus
-share button (seed, link)
-reset 
    ->reset button for random based on which random chosen
-highscore ?
-let the playfield scale with text based on resolution to keep screen ratio
-shorten the seed produced for small shapes (maybe using the following library:"https://github.com/MikeMcl/bignumber.js)
    -if shorten works: -show small shapes seed


FIXED BUGS
-RANDOM BIG SHAPES sometimes presented blank site in first gen, when the start seed was containing only B'scale
    ->now checks, if site is blank, if so: produce new seed
-unwanted behaviour when textfield has input and any random button is pressed
    ->clear textfield before displaying the site for corresponding random button


BUGS
-page empty when hitting f5
-insert generic string other than the specific seed format then pressing BY SEED breaks site
-"Uncaught InternalError: allocation size overflow" happens when playing around with seeds and chose numbers too big which lets the string overflow
-pressing start button more than once makes the game go faster and breaks the stop button for some reason
