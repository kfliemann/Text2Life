DONE
-random button which inserts random text to let the player play around with random shapes
-convert text to seed & let create by seed (for BIG SHAPES)

FIXED BUGS
-RANDOM BIG SHAPES sometimes presented blank site in first gen, when the start seed was containing only B'scale
    ->now checks, if site is blank, if so: produce new seed

TODO
-pause when losing focus
-share button (seed, link)
-show seed if avaliable on site
-show generation
-reset / new game 
    ->reset button for random based on which random chosen
-highscore ?
-slider to make the jump between generations faster or slower
-let the playfield scale with text based on resolution to keep screen ratio
-convert text to seed & let create by seed (for SMALL SHAPES)
    -encode by columns

BUGS
-page empty when hitting f5
-insert generic string other than the specific seed format then pressing BY SEED breaks site
-"Uncaught InternalError: allocation size overflow" happens when playing around with seeds and chose numbers too big which lets the string overflow
